## Problem 1

Loading the homicide dataset then cleaning it

``` r
homicides = 
  read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv")
```

    ## Rows: 52179 Columns: 12
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (9): uid, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex...
    ## dbl (3): reported_date, lat, lon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
clean_df =
  homicides |>
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state),        
    solved = if_else(disposition == "Closed by arrest", 1, 0),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)
  ) |>
  filter(
    !(city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL")),
    victim_race %in% c("White","Black")
  )
```

    ## Warning: There was 1 warning in `mutate()`.
    ## ℹ In argument: `victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)`.
    ## Caused by warning:
    ## ! NAs introduced by coercion

Baltimore only logistic regression:

``` r
baltimore_df =
  clean_df |>
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

baltimore_model =
  glm(
    solved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race,
    data = baltimore_df,
    family= binomial()
  )
```

Let’s get the adjusted OR and 95% CI for male vs female:

``` r
baltimore_results=
  baltimore_model |> 
  tidy(conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate=TRUE)

baltimore_results |> 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") |> 
  select(term, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 4
    ##   term           estimate conf.low conf.high
    ##   <chr>             <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1 victim_sexMale    0.426    0.324     0.558

glm for each city, OR and 95% CI:

``` r
city_models =
  clean_df |>
  group_by(city_state) |>
  nest() |>
  mutate(
    model=map(data,
      ~ glm(
          solved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race,
          data= .x,
          family = binomial()
        )
    ),
    results= map(model,
      ~ tidy(.x, conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate= TRUE)
    )
  )
```

    ## Warning: There were 43 warnings in `mutate()`.
    ## The first warning was:
    ## ℹ In argument: `results = map(model, ~tidy(.x, conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate =
    ##   TRUE))`.
    ## ℹ In group 1: `city_state = "Albuquerque, NM"`.
    ## Caused by warning:
    ## ! glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred
    ## ℹ Run `dplyr::last_dplyr_warnings()` to see the 42 remaining warnings.

to get male vs female in each city:

``` r
city_or_df=
  city_models |> 
  unnest(results) |> 
  filter(term=="victim_sexMale") |> 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

Plotting OR and CI by city:

``` r
city_or_df |>
  mutate(city_state= fct_reorder(city_state,estimate)) |>   
  ggplot(aes(x =estimate, y = city_state)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = conf.low, xmax = conf.high), height = 0.2) +
  labs(
    title ="Solved Homicides: Male vs Female Victims",
    x = "Adjusted Odds Ratio",
    y = "City"
  ) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 12) +
  theme(
    axis.text.y =element_text(size = 5)
  )
```

The odds ratio varies significantly across the cities. I’d say in most
cities, the adjusted OR is below 1, which means homicides with male
victims are less likely to be solved compared to ones with female
victims after adjusting for age and race. Some cities have adjusted ORs
of 1 or higher, but they have a wide confidence intervals, so this could
mean that they may have has a smaller sample size or even uncertainity.
Generally, the pattern we see is that male victim homicides are solved
less frequently.
